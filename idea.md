# Evergreen Multi Agents

## Idea
- I want a multi agent system that parses the m365 roadmap (https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=) and transforms it to a database that is embedded so i cant vector search on it. I think there might be a api for the roadmap as well.
- I want to be able to ask questions about the roadmap and get answers from the database.
- I also want to create, update customers i have so to a different database.
- I want to be able to ask questions about the customers and get answers from the database.
- I want to be able to determine wich change in the roadmap has high impact on a specific customer
- I want to be able to run weekly reports per customer.
- The whole system should be a multi agent system where different agents are called by a orchestrator agent.
- Some agents should have tools to f.e. edit the database, retrieve stuff from the database
- the programm should be done in google adk with uv and python
- If i miss stuff or something is unclear i want you to ask me question how it should be designed.
